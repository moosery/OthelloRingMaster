## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Initial solution scaffold and Utility project port

- Created the `OthelloRingMaster` Visual Studio solution: a fresh, isolated
  solution (separate from `OthelloLevelBlaster`) for building a ring-ordered,
  GPU-native board+outcome tablebase for Othello (see README for the mission).
- Ported the `Utility` subproject from `OthelloLevelBlaster` -- `ArenaMem`,
  `BinarySearch`/`BinSearchLE`, `ClockTick`, `DriveInfo`, `Error`,
  `FileAndDirUtils`, `Logger`, `Mem`, `RWLock`, `SysMemInfo`, `ThreadPool` --
  and reformatted every file to this project's C style (file/function header
  banners, section markers, aligned declarations and comments).
- Set up version control: this code repo (public, matching
  `OthelloLevelBlaster`'s convention) and a separate private repo backing
  Claude's project memory.
